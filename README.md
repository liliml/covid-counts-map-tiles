**Satellite Basemap (deliverable tileset 1)** 
This map is of the United States and is a satellite view. The source for this data is from mapbox legacy themes: 
(https://docs.mapbox.com/api/maps/styles/)[https://docs.mapbox.com/api/maps/styles/] 
The available zoom levels for this map are from 0 to 6. Any larger resulted in longer loading times
both to create the tiles for export and when using the tiles. A screenshot of this basemap can be seen below.
